    Threading-based lock implementation using asyncio.to_thread wrapper.

    This implementation uses a threading.Lock wrapped with asyncio.to_thread
    to provide async compatibility while supporting both coroutine and thread
    concurrency scenarios within a single process.

    Features:
    - Works in single-process multi-coroutine environments (celery --pool=solo)
    - Works in single-process multi-thread environments (celery --pool=threads)
    - Does NOT work across multiple processes (celery --pool=prefork)
    - Non-blocking for the event loop (uses background thread pool)

    Performance:
    - Higher overhead than asyncio.Lock but supports broader concurrency models
    - Lower overhead than distributed locks for single-process scenarios
