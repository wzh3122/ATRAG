Universal Concurrent Control Module

A flexible and reusable concurrent control system that provides unified locking
mechanisms for any Python application. Designed to handle different deployment
scenarios and task queue environments.

Features:
- Auto-managed locks with default manager
- Flexible timeout support
- Universal applicability
- Easy extensibility
- Production ready with comprehensive error handling

Quick Start:
    from atrag.concurrent_control import get_or_create_lock, lock_context

    # Create/get a managed lock (most common usage)
    my_lock = get_or_create_lock("database_operations")

    # Use with default behavior
    async with my_lock:
        await critical_work()

    # Use with timeout
    async with lock_context(my_lock, timeout=5.0):
        await critical_work()
"""

from .manager import (
    LockManager,  # noqa: F401  # Available for testing and advanced usage
    create_lock,  # Create new locks
    get_default_lock_manager,  # Access default manager for advanced operations
    get_lock,  # Retrieve existing locks
    get_or_create_lock,  # Get existing or create new (recommended)
)
from .protocols import LockProtocol  # noqa: F401  # Available for testing and advanced usage
from .redis_lock import RedisLock  # noqa: F401  # Available for testing and advanced usage
from .threading_lock import ThreadingLock  # noqa: F401  # Available for testing and advanced usage
from .utils import lock_context  # ⭐ Timeout support for locks

    "get_lock",  # Get existing lock only

    "lock_context",  # ⭐ Timeout support for locks
    # Advanced/internal (use sparingly)
    "get_default_lock_manager",  # Advanced lock management
]

# Note: ThreadingLock, RedisLock, LockProtocol, LockManager are available
# for testing and advanced usage but not in __all__ to keep public API simple
